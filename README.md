# KanhaiyaJavaRPC

This is just a sample Java XML-RPC Server project. I am using apache xmlrpc libraries for setting up the server. This project was used for connecting a C++ XML-RPC client to Java XML-RPC Server. 
C++ XML-RPC client is [here](https://github.com/kanhaiyakumawat/xmlrpccppclient).

I have intentionally kept the the Jar files and binaries inside the repo.
